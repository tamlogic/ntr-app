# NTR App

The good type of NTR ( if you know what I mean üòè ) which stands for Next.js - tRPC - React Native.

## Installation

For Next.js / tRPC

```bash
  yarn install
  yarn dev
```

For Expo App

```bash
  cd src/app && yarn install
  yarn start
```

Make sure to run the next js dev server first, and open it in a new tab by visiting http://localhost:3000/ before running the Expo App.

## Why This Repo

I was trying to find some kind of way which allowed me to use the tRPC goodness in RN as well.
All the solutions that I did find were either not updated, or janky at best.
So, I created my own starter which allows to share the tRPC server between Next.js and Expo based RN App.

## Credits

- Used [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) as the base for Next.js + tRPC app.
- Used basic [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/) for the expo app.
